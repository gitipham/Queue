/** Driver Class
 * Program: Simulate 60 minutes of activity at the store. Each iteration of the program represents one minute.
 * At each iteration (minute), the program will do the following:
 *   Check to see if new customers are added to the queue.
 *   There is a 25% chance that new customers show up (need to be added to the queue) every minute.
 *   Each iteration will have its own 25% chance.
 *   Update the customer object currently being serviced (if one exists).
 *   This will be the customer object at the front of the queue.  If the customer has been completely serviced, remove them from the queue.
